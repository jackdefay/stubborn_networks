Network systems (ECE 4960) final project: Opinion Dynamics in Stubborn, Clustered Networks

Opinion dynamics is the study of networks where agents, the nodes of the network, hold some opinion, and are influenced by the agents they are connected to, the edges of the network. The weight of the edge can correspond to how strong a tie these agents have. A cluster is a subgroup of nodes within a network that share some sort of common characteristic.

In real-world opinion dynamics, we aren't just influenced by those around us, but also by our own willingness to accept new opinions and information. Some of us are simply more stubborn than others. Thus, a stubborn clustered network is a term we came up with to classify a network that contains a cluster of nodes with very low openness to changing their opinion.

This project explores under what conditions can an intervention change opinion dynamics in stubborn clustered networks.
